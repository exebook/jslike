#jslike - JavaScript-like var/Array/Object/function for C++

C++ has it's own powerful ways of doing things, but when it comes to quick prototyping it sucks. jslike let's you create objects, assign properties, use arrays and strings a JavaScript way right in your C++ code by exposing the single `var` class.


```cpp
	var a = arr;
	a.push("hello");
	a.push("world");
	console.log(a);
	set(a) = 1,2,3,4,5;
	
```
